Data used in experiments described in the paper "Classification-based detection of glottal closure instants from speech signals".

An example of a Python code to train and test a classifier used to detect glottal closure instants (GCIs), including a brief data and classification procedure description, is shown in `GCI_detection.html`. The corresponding interactive Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the iPython notebook) is available in `GCI_detection.ipynb`. Please see the [official page](http://jupyter.org/) for an information on how to launch the jupyter notebook.
